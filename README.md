Introducing "Good Tea"! â™¥â˜•

With this incredible mod, you can brew tea using anything! While not every item will have an effect, a good chunk of them will, giving you a unique tea-drinking experience every time. âœ¨

So, how do you make a kettle and a mug to start brewing?

For the mug, you'll have to get some White Glazed Terracotta and a stone cutter.

And for the Kettle you'll have to get some copper, a cauldron and a bucket.

But wait, there's more! If you like some action with your tea, the "Good Tea" mod works seamlessly with the ["Kahur"](https://modrinth.com/mod/kahur) mod ðŸ”«, allowing you to shoot tea cups!
